ageSelect:
score>0 indicates provider states preference for older men
why this is interesting:
(a) older men may be less likely to be pimps => pimp control
(b) older men may be physically less stronger => less chance of violence
(c) older men may be sexually less demanding
(c) older men may be more able and more willing to pay => less chance of client not paying

raceEthnicSelect:
score>0 indicates provider states preference for white men/against black men
why this is interesting:
(a) presumption that black men may be pimps who would interfere with relationship with current pimp => pimp control
(b) presumption that black men are physically stronger and/or sexually more demanding

multiProvider:
score>0 indicates provider states willingness to invole a second provider
why this is interesting:
(a) two providers may be in a co-opted/unwilling dynamic where the (typically older, more experienced) woman is being included to controland keep an eye on the (typically younger) trafficked one

providerYouth:
score>0 indicates language in ad accentuating provider's youthfulness
why this is interesting:
(a) provider may be a minor

briefDuration:
score>0 indicates language in ad suggesting provider has just arrived in town, is in town for a short time, and/or is leaving soon
why this is interesting:
(a) provider movement, especially after brief stays, is correlated with pimp control, keeping the provider from establishing any roots and making her more dependent on him
(b) provider movement may be correlated with fear or prosecution/flight

ethnicityNationality:
score>0 indicates language in ad describing race or ethnicity, generally of the provider (not the client).  Only matches for various Asian and Latina are performed at present
why this is interesting:
(a) may assist with identification
(b) may assist with disambiguating named entities

incall:
score>0 indicates language in ad suggesting provider wants client to come to location under her control, typically a hotel room or apartment, less commonly a spa/massage/strip club location
why this is interesting:
(a) different enforcement priority/policing procedure
(b) may be positively correlated with older, more established, less pimp controlled providers

outcall:
score>0 indicates language in ad suggesting provider willing to come to client's location (typically hotel room, some are willing to come to private residence)
why this is interesting:
(a) difference enforcement priority/policing procedure
(b) may be positively correlated with younger, less established, more pimp controlled providers

agency:
score>0 indicates language in ad regarding agencies.  There are two meanings of this word: (1) an escort agency which provides a set of providers and may exercise some control in which provider is assigned to which client; (2) law enforcement agency (less common)
why this is interesting:
(a) most providers self-identify as independent, denying both pimp control and agency affiliation, as both of these have negative connotations.  When self-identifying positively with agency affiliation, it is often correlated with higher prices (agency gets a cut).  Agencies suggest their providers are more elite, more exclusive.  Because of the fee structure, may be correlated with more established, older provider

notagency:
score>0 indicates language in ad denying agency affiliation
why this is interesting:
(a) may be statement of independence
(b) may be (vain) attempt to forbid law enforcement agencies to contact provider, to avoid prosecution

incalloutcall:
score>0 indicates language in ad suggesting willingness for both incall and outcall, possibly at different times/locations
why this is important:
(a) use as negative category to improve precision of incall, outcall

notincall:
score>0 indicates language suggesting unwillingness to perform incall services
why this is important
(a) use as negative category to improve precision of incall, outcall

notoutcall:

names:
score>0 indicates text in ad tending to indicate working name.  Very approximate

superbowl, meadowlands, allstar, NBA:
score>0 indicates text in ad indicating sporting event, presumably provider is indicating she is in town for the event in question
why this is important
(a) hypothesis that trafficked women are brought in to service the largely male attendance at major sporting events
